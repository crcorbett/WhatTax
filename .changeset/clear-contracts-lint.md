Adopt the stricter shared Oxlint policy and use precise public contract names.
Rename vague service `Shape` types to `Contract`, rename
`SourceExtract.shape` to `rowContract`, keep trace values JSON-safe, and add
preferred `create*` constructors while retaining deprecated `make*` aliases
where compatibility is safe.
